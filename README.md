# Genomic-data-analysis_Gene-expression
- The purpose of this project is to demonstrate that I can figure out how to execute genomic data analysis on my own.

- The goal of this project is to answer the following question: what is the difference between gene expression in fetal and adult brains. 

- The full project execution is written inside the `Gene-Expression.Rmd` / `Gene-Expression.pdf` file. (There is a necessity to download the `Gene-Expression.pdf` file in order to view it.)

- For this project I used Galaxy analysis platform and R programming language.
